## 0.1.0 (2021-03-24)
- No need for `filePath` keyword in the `.pouch.yml` output if there is a single path (with multiple config options you need to type parameter names, similar to how secret parsing works).
- `pouch` will now by default run `pouch retrieve`.
- Fixed a bug where if you didn't provide output language it would print parser error.

## 0.0.1 (2021-03-15)
